***maily there are three subset of artificial intelligence***
- deep learning
- machine learning
- nural network
*let's talk about them in detail.*
### about deep learning
**define**
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.
application
- Automatic speech recognition
- Image recognition
- Visual art processing
- Recommendation systems
- Bioinformatics
- Medical Image Analysis
- Mobile advertising
- Image restoration
- Financial fraud detection
- Military
etc... 
# uses:- 
**automatic speech recognition:-**
Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called "speaker independent" systems. Systems that use training are called "speaker dependent".

Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. "call home"), call routing (e.g. "I would like to make a collect call"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).

The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.

From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.

> **image recognition**
ex:-
image recognition is used in camera.
you have seen multiplw times that when you are going to take selfie then the camera says that the object is men or woman or dog etc..



# what is machine learning??

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building


> history
The term machine learning was coined in  by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters ( letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.

> overvew....
Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step

suppose you are searching for chocolates in the web then their machine learning comes it trackes what are you searching then it gives ad of that product,so ads are seen by machine learning.

neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

it is series of algorithms

Theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the analysis and computational modeling of biological neural systems. Since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behaviour, the field is closely related to cognitive and behavioural modeling.

The aim of the field is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work. To gain this understanding, neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes (data), biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning (biological neural network models) and theory (statistical learning theory and information theory).

### maybe some of are you confusing that what is algorithm but don't worry let me tell you
An algorithm is a set of rules that defines how a perticular problem can be solved in a finite number of steps
understand like this-
think your teacher had given a program to input two integer numbers sum it then print it.What will you do??
here's what you do
you will plane a strategy that first we have to made three variables then take input two numbers then on the third variable we store sum of two numbers then print it.

the simple Strategy you have planned that is algorithm.

## characteristics of a good algorithm
program is representation of an algorithm in a programming language does efficiency of a program depends on these two factors of algorithm.
1.correctness of algorithm :-whether the algorithm is yielding correct results/output with the given set of inputs.
2. efficiency of an algorithm :- how fast it is? how much is there it takes to give final result ? how is simple or complex steps it uses to solve the problem? and how much resources such as memory it uses?
### uses of algorithm
 algorithms are used in all types of programming there at standard efficient algorithms available for a variety of task some examples of algorithm uses include:-
1.search engines. algorithms are used for efficient searching over internet.
2.Weather forecasting:- There are specifically designed weather forecasting algorithms study study the satellite pictures and weather patterns.
3.sorting:- algorithms can sort a small group of data to use enormous amount of data.
4. pattern recognition:-feels like fingerprint matching of face recognition etc algorithms plays a very important role.

### developing an algorithm
steps
- obtain description of the problem
explanation:-detailed description ads to better solutions always go for clear descriptions also be clear about the assumptions made if any for example in a test result system mostly it is assumed that maximum marks are hundred so it is important to clarify assumptions and be sure about things
- analyse the problem
explanation:-analyse to figure out what is to be calculated or produced from a given set of input conditions values analyse if any data is dependent upon other data for example in an annual result if marks weightage from term examinations is to be added that final result is also dependent on term end result
- higher level algorithm
 firstly come up with that develop a high level algorithm that includes the major part of a solution i.e,major steps of a solution
- find the algorithm by adding more details
explanation:-now refine algorithm and include - steps also ensure that right data gets used ensure that if maximum marks are hundred then no marks enter more than hundred
- review and test the algorithm
explanation:-finally review the algorithms step carefully and test it with a simple set of values whether it producing correct result or not
