I don't give too many fks to people who don't know thyself nor me.
I remember the time when I was all alone in a situation, not understandable to others nor needed any explanation.
I worked hard, rised, flied, fell, suffered, then started living , working hard, rising without toxic pride but with concious thinking with understanding and still not over valuing anything.
